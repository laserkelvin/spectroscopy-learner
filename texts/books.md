## General Spectroscopy

The books by Gerhard Herzberg are great reference materials, no matter your career stage:

1. [[herzberg-v1]]
2. [[herzberg-v2]]
3. [[herzberg-v3]]
4. [[herzberg-v4]]

The first few chapters of volumes I-III are especially approachable for undergraduate
and graduate students, and provide a great foundation for molecular spectroscopy.

[*Molecular Symmetry and Spectroscopy*](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Symmetry-Spectroscopy-Jensen/dp/0660175193/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=molecular+symmetry+and+spectroscopy&qid=1637595212&sr=8-1) by Jensen and Bunker is advanced reading; if you can get through it you can probably spectroscopy.

## Vibrational Spectroscopy

[*Molecular Vibrations*](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Vibrations-Infrared-Vibrational-Chemistry/dp/048663941X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=molecular+vibrations&qid=1637595069&sr=8-1) by [[wilson-decius-cross]] provides a significant amount of background for vibrational spectroscopy,
especially with respect to how computational chemistry codes compute infrared spectra (i.e. the $FG$ method).
This book is quite heavy on linear algebra, and so a passing understanding of matrix methods is recommended.

This book is also published by Dover, and so it's incredibly affordable (like tens of dollars).

## [Rotational Spectroscopy](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Microwave-Small-Works-Alexa/dp/B07894S727/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=microwave+molecular+spectra&qid=1637595536&sr=8-4)

*Microwave Molecular Spectra* by [[gordy-cook]] provides a very approachable ramp up for fundamentals
of rotational spectroscopy, starting from derivations of Hamiltonians for linear, symmetric, and asymmetric
[[rigid-rotor]]s, followed by perturbative effects such as [[centrifugal-distortion]], [[hyperfine-splitting]], magnetic fields, etc.

*Microwave Spectroscopy* by [[townes-schawlow]] is an incredibly comprehensive text, which complements [[gordy-cook]].
Their approach is probably a bit more from the physics side of things, whereas IMHO [[gordy-cook]] is more approachable
for physical chemists.
