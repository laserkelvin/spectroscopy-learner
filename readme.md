# Spectroscopy Learner

This website is intended to be an open-source collection of spectroscopy concepts; aside from
the [holy texts](texts/books.md), I felt that it was overdue that common elements of molecular
spectroscopy were consolidated into a single location, perhaps in a more opinionated way than
normal.

The intended scope is anything to do with molecular spectroscopy, ranging from basic derivations
of energy levels and intensities, to illustrative case studies (in the Herzberg style), to code
implementations of concepts (preferably in a high level language like Python or Julia). The motivation is to connect textbook concepts with concrete implementations/cases.

## Contributions

Given that this project is open-source, I hope that others will help fill in the gaps as they
learn, and to help correct mistakes found: please create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/laserkelvin/spectroscopy-learner/issues)
to bring anything up. Contributions from all are welcome: you needn't be a Professor to add
to the body of knowledge, although I would ask you to include references/citations for detailed
additions.
